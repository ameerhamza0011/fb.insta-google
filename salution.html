		<h3>SOMETHING ABIUT ME</h3>
		<p>The idea behind this project is to provide customer convenience and a new way to place orders for home delivery and table reservation and also to increase the sales of restaurant. Ordering is a process of customers specifying what they want, so that the order can be recorded by a note, form, computer system and many others followed by passing it to the relevant department for processing and finally delivery of the services or products to the customers based on the orders. Reservation is the act or an instance of reserving something especially restaurant table, hotel accommodation, a seat on an airplane, etc. It is a system that provides fast and accurate information about availability of product and services.
